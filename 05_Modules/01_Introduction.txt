Modules:
- A gruop of functions, variables and classes, saved to a file which is nothing but a module.
- Every Python file (.py) is act as module.

Types of modules:
    1. User defined modules : Modules created by user.
    2. Built in modules     : Already present in python. Eg. math, calender, date, time etc
    3. External modules     : We have to download and use this modules. Eg. numpy, pandas etc

Multiple ways of importing module:
    1. import module_name
    2. from module_name import member
    3. from module_name import member1, member2
    4. from module_name import *
    5. import module_name as alise_module_name 
    6. from module_name import member as alise_member_name
    7. from module_name import member1 as alise_member1_name, member2 as alise_member2_name

dir() function:
    1. dir(): To listout all members of current module.
    2. dir(module_name): To listout all members of specified module.

Special variable __name__ :
- In Every python program, Special variable __name__ added internally.
- This variable stores information regarding program is executed as individual program or as a module.
- if program executed as individual program,
  then value of __name__ is __main__
- if program executed as module from some other program,
  then value of __name__ is name of module.
